# This is PastaCopy
A pastebin clone with a unique UI designed to suit your needs just the way you want

To set this up at your local machine: 

1. Locate "sample.config.php" in the root folder and /php/
2. Replace "dummyusername" with your MySQL server root name
3. Replace "dummypassword" with your corresponding password
4. Make sure you replaced the credentials in both the "sample.config.php" files in the root directory and /php/
5. Rename these files to "config.php" (Without the quotes :P)
6. Set up the databse schema using the XML file inside /schema/
7. You're done!
8. Star my repo!
